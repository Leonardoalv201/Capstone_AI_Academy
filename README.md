On this project we will create a model to predict heart diseases using a dataset obtained from github [1] 

We are looking for an acurracy higher than 80% and less than 5% of false negattives on our confusion matrix

Metrics to measure the model results:
* Accuracy
* Confusion matrix

[1] Dataset: https://github.com/jayachandru001/Heart-Failure-Prediction-/tree/main
